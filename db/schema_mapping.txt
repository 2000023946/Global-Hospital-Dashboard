Schema Mapping (Team 89)
Person(ssn, birthdate, address, firstname, lastname)
Patient(ssn[FK14], contact, funds)
FK14 : ssn → Person(ssn)

that department.

Order(orderNumber, priority, date, cost, ssn[FK4], licenseNumber[FK5])
FK4 : ssn → Person(ssn)

information for the order
● On update restrict → each order is only for one patient, and you can’t update
FK5 : licenseNumber → Doctor(liscenseNumber)
● On delete restrict → order must have a doctor associated with it if there is no doctor
there could be no order

change.

occupied and still exists.
